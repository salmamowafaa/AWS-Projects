📸 Project: Image Auto-Tagging with Amazon Rekognition

README

---

✅ What It Does

This serverless project automatically tags images uploaded to an S3 bucket using Amazon Rekognition.

When an image is uploaded:

1.⁠ ⁠An AWS Lambda function is triggered  
2.⁠ ⁠The image is analyzed using Amazon Rekognition to detect labels (e.g., "Person", "Car", "Outdoor")  
3.⁠ ⁠Detected labels are stored in a DynamoDB table for future reference or search  

Perfect for:

•⁠  ⁠Smart media libraries  
•⁠  ⁠Content filtering  
•⁠  ⁠Metadata enrichment  


🔧 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Step 1: Create the S3 Bucket*

1.⁠ ⁠Open the *[Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)*  
2.⁠ ⁠Click Create bucket  
3.⁠ ⁠Choose a unique name (e.g., image-tagging-bucket-yourname)  
4.⁠ ⁠⚠ For testing only: Uncheck "Block all public access" if you need public access (not recommended for production)  
5.⁠ ⁠(Optional) Enable versioning for resilience  
6.⁠ ⁠Click Create bucket  

	⁠This bucket will hold your uploaded images and trigger the Lambda function.

Step 2: Create the DynamoDB Table*

1.⁠ ⁠Go to the *[DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)*  
2.⁠ ⁠Click Create table  
3.⁠ ⁠Table name: ImageLabels  
4.⁠ ⁠Partition key: imageName (Type: String)  
5.⁠ ⁠Leave other settings as default and click Create  

	⁠This table will store image names and their detected labels.

Step 3: Create the Lambda Function*

1.⁠ ⁠Navigate to the *[AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)*  
2.⁠ ⁠Click Create function  
3.⁠ ⁠Select Author from scratch  
4.⁠ ⁠Function name: ImageTaggingFunction  
5.⁠ ⁠Runtime: Python 3.12  
6.⁠ ⁠Permissions: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions  

	⁠This function will process S3 upload events and analyze images.

Step 4: Add Lambda Code*
(Add your Lambda function code here.)

Step 5: Set Up S3 Event Trigger*

1.⁠ ⁠Go to your S3 bucket → Properties tab  
2.⁠ ⁠Scroll to Event notifications → Click Create event notification  
3.⁠ ⁠Configure:  
   - Name: LambdaTrigger  
   - Event types: Put Object  
   - Send to: Lambda function  
   - Lambda function: Select ImageTaggingFunction  
4.⁠ ⁠Save  

	⁠Now, every image upload will invoke your Lambda function.

---

Step 6: Configure IAM Permissions*

Ensure your Lambda execution role has the required permissions:

1.⁠ ⁠Go to *[IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)* → Roles  
2.⁠ ⁠Find the role attached to ImageTaggingFunction  
3.⁠ ⁠Attach the following managed policies:  
   - AmazonRekognitionFullAccess  
   - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess  
   - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  

	⁠These permissions allow Lambda to access S3, call Rekognition, and write to DynamoDB.

---

✅ Testing the System

1.⁠ ⁠Upload an image (e.g., cat.jpg) to your S3 bucket  
2.⁠ ⁠Wait a few seconds for processing  
3.⁠ ⁠Go to DynamoDB Console → ImageLabels → Explore table  
4.⁠ ⁠Look for an entry with your image name and a list of detected labels (e.g., ["Cat", "Animal", "Pet"])

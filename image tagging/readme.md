üì∏ Project: Image Auto-Tagging with Amazon Rekognition

README

---

‚úÖ What It Does

This serverless project automatically tags images uploaded to an S3 bucket using Amazon Rekognition.

When an image is uploaded:

1.‚Å† ‚Å†An AWS Lambda function is triggered  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†The image is analyzed using Amazon Rekognition to detect labels (e.g., "Person", "Car", "Outdoor")  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Detected labels are stored in a DynamoDB table for future reference or search  

Perfect for:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Smart media libraries  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Content filtering  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Metadata enrichment  


üîß Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Step 1: Create the S3 Bucket*

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Open the *[Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)*  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Click Create bucket  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Choose a unique name (e.g., image-tagging-bucket-yourname)  
4.‚Å† ‚Å†‚ö† For testing only: Uncheck "Block all public access" if you need public access (not recommended for production)  
5.‚Å† ‚Å†(Optional) Enable versioning for resilience  
6.‚Å† ‚Å†Click Create bucket  

	‚Å†This bucket will hold your uploaded images and trigger the Lambda function.

Step 2: Create the DynamoDB Table*

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Go to the *[DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)*  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Click Create table  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Table name: ImageLabels  
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Partition key: imageName (Type: String)  
5.‚Å† ‚Å†Leave other settings as default and click Create  

	‚Å†This table will store image names and their detected labels.

---

Step 3: Create the Lambda Function*

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Navigate to the *[AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)*  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Click Create function  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Select Author from scratch  
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Function name: ImageTaggingFunction  
5.‚Å† ‚Å†Runtime: Python 3.12  
6.‚Å† ‚Å†Permissions: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions  

	‚Å†This function will process S3 upload events and analyze images.

Step 4: Add Lambda Code*
(Add your Lambda function code here.)

---

Step 5: Set Up S3 Event Trigger*

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Go to your S3 bucket ‚Üí Properties tab  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Scroll to Event notifications ‚Üí Click Create event notification  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Configure:  
   - Name: LambdaTrigger  
   - Event types: Put Object  
   - Send to: Lambda function  
   - Lambda function: Select ImageTaggingFunction  
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Save  

	‚Å†Now, every image upload will invoke your Lambda function.

---

Step 6: Configure IAM Permissions*

Ensure your Lambda execution role has the required permissions:

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Go to *[IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)* ‚Üí Roles  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Find the role attached to ImageTaggingFunction  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Attach the following managed policies:  
   - AmazonRekognitionFullAccess  
   - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess  
   - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  

	‚Å†These permissions allow Lambda to access S3, call Rekognition, and write to DynamoDB.

---

‚úÖ Testing the System

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Upload an image (e.g., cat.jpg) to your S3 bucket  
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Wait a few seconds for processing  
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Go to DynamoDB Console ‚Üí ImageLabels ‚Üí Explore table  
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Look for an entry with your image name and a list of detected labels (e.g., ["Cat", "Animal", "Pet"])
